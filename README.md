Welcome to my working directory for Open Omega modifications. Many thanks to DMS for making this project open source!

My initial focus is to develop a replacement for the 304 stainless fine wire mesh and 3M 468MP adhesive. In the future, I plan to design a new headband and explore potential case modifications.
