## Gyroid Driver Grill

**Status:** Prototype - Testing Required

This design has only been test-fitted into the omega driver cap. The impact on sound quality and frequency response tuning remains untested and may require design revisions to optimize pad adhesion. 

Two variants are available:
- **Standard version:** Complete grill without cutouts
- **Serial plate version:** Center hole removed with integrated mounting area for the serial plate (as demonstrated in DMS's build video)
